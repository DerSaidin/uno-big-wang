Uno Rules.... plus

To start deal 10 cards to each player (for 4 players, not sure on scaling)
Flip card to start; if first card is a King/Ace, distribute

Ace => Pickup: 4 (can match any Ace/King)

King => Pickup: 2 (can match any Ace/King)

Queen => Movement: reverse

Jack => Movement: skip 1

Movement
- can match Ace/King of same suit
- can be combo'd with Ace/King/Queen/Jack (all movement must be first in turn)

Joker => players choice: 2 to Q

Numbers
- same suit can be chained (7, 8, 9, 10) (stops at 10, cant chain numbers into royalty)
    - joker can change suit mid chain (joker must be a number, suit change for rest of chain)
- same number can be chained (10, 10, 10, 10)

BIG WANG
- reflects pickups back to anyone who participated in the pickupcards chain
- distribute backwards 1 at a time until
- opaque (card below)
- BIG WANG counters BIG WANG by moving shield to last BIG WANG

Can't win by playing multiple cards

Must honestly answer "how many cards?" (if you have more than 10 "lots" is acceptable answer)

No cards in hands wins
- this resolves after card pickups
  e.g. next person can WANG [attempted] winner, or continue with King/Ace
       (this could come around to the person with no cards and hit them, so the game does not end)
